# tab Interpreter
## What is this?
This is my interpreter for the [tab](https://esolangs.org/wiki/T_a_b) esolang. It is written in python, because it only has one command.
## How to run?
```
git clone https://github.com/benni347/tab.git
cd tab
python3 main.py
```
## Diffrence between interpreter and compiler?
The interpreter reads tab code and outpouts the ASCII representation of the code. The compiler reads ASCII symbols and outputs the tab representation of the code in a file.
